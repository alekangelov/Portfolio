    <p>
      Hi, I'm Alek ðŸ‘‹! I'm currently the lead Front End Developer over at{" "}
      <a href="https://digitalpresent.io">DigitalPresent.io</a>. I'm based out
      of Skopje with a huge emphasis on animation, UI/UX and interaction design.
    </p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      While I'm technically and professionally a front end developer, I like to
      code the back-end as well. The backend part comes from a need to code my
      APIs and then it kinda blossomed into this thing where I kind of want to
      do backend as well. Laravel and Slim frameworks on PHP and Express and
      Adonis on Node.

    <h2>Persona</h2>

    <p>
      Yo, you got this far ðŸ‘€? To be really honest, it's quite a boring, long
      page with vague pictures of me and I honestly would be surprised if anyone
      got here ðŸ˜‚.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live in the Cevahir Sky City Skyscrapers in Skopje on the 21st floor. My
      name is Alek Angelov. I'm 23 years old. I believe in taking care of
      myself, in a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning
      if I'm late for work, I skip the cardio and head out to work after my
      morning routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, after work, I go to the gym. Where I follow a powerlifting
      program designed to make me stronger. I can deadlift about 405lbs, now.
      After the gym, I go to the sauna for 10minutes to open my pores so I can
      clean them easier to prevent build up in my skin. After the sauna, I
      shower with a body exfoliator to keep my skin healthy and clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to eat a pretty bro diet, consisting of chicken wraps and
      vegetables. Low carb, moderate fat and high in protein, as to keep my fat
      storage to a minimum. During my one meal a day, I like to watch anime or
      western shows. My favorite currently, is Jojo's Bizarre Adventures. I have
      a nighttime routine that consists of exfoliating gel, cleansing tonic, and
      night creme. I go to bed, healthy and tired in a 100% dark room to
      maximize muscle protein synthesis during sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an idea of an Alek Angelov. Some kind of abstraction. But there
      is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide
      my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and
      maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply
      am not there.

          <h4>Lead Front End Engineer</h4>
          <p>
            At a digital agency, you're tasking with a lot of different jobs. I
            have to figure out what's the best for the job, prototype it and
            pitch it. I have to manage the whole front end and most of the time
            the back end as well. Wrote a lot of Node and React here and built a
            ton of apps for both iOS and Android and the web.

          <h4>Software Developer</h4>
          <p>
            I did full-stack development and maintenance for one of the biggest
            CRM software for clinics. I also spearheaded a design team and lead
            change updating their legacy software and pushing the software to
            new heights using React, NextJS, TypeScript, and NodeJS. Prototyped
            a live chat application that integrated with the current database,
            while managing its own and a React Native cross-platform app that
            never saw the light of day.

                  A React Native app that focuses on fitness. Buying workouts,
                  tracking workouts and sharing workouts. I made a fully
                  functional beta app but backed off of the project because of
                  incompetent backend developers.

                  I redesign and redevelop this every couple of months. I

                  the current iteration.

                  downloads on NPM the first week. I'm actively maintaining it
                  and I hope that people will learn from it and use it.

                  The front-end is all hand-written with a custom router. I
                  decided I wanted to learn how to make a router, so I thought
                  up this project to teach myself that.
